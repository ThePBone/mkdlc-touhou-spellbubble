# mkdlc-touhou-spellbubble
Generate DLC unlocker NSPs for Touhou Spell Bubble from scratch.

**Important: This repository does not contain any copyrighted material. NSPs are generated from scratch using free open-source tools provided by the Homebrew community.**

## Prerequisites

  * Dump the production decryption keys (`prod.keys`) from your Nintendo Switch using LockpickRCM and put them into `~/.switch/prod.keys`.
  * Install [hacpack](https://github.com/The-4n/hacPack) on your system and make sure that the `hacpack` binary is added to `$PATH` (e.g. by installing hacpack into `/usr/local/bin`)


## Usage

Generate all possible DLC unlock packages from #1 up to #100.
```
./mkdlc.sh
```
There are currently only about 40 DLCs available, so the other 60 packages won't do anything at the moment. They may unlock future DLC content that hasn't been yet released though.

Actual DLC content is distributed through game updates that are received by everyone. The NSPs generated by this script only act as the activation keys.
